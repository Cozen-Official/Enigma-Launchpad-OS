# Mochie Folder

The **Mochie Folder** type provides global control of **Mochie Screen FX** shaders with a comprehensive six-page preset layout. It includes +/- controls, color selectors, AudioLink integration, and major effect toggles.

## Overview

Mochie Folder is specifically designed for the Mochie Screen FX shader system (both free and Patreon SFX X versions). It offers:

- Six-page preset layout for organized controls
- Global control across multiple screens
- +/- adjustment controls for precise values
- Color selector for outline colors
- AudioLink band toggles
- AudioLink strength controls
- Major effect toggles
- Configurable default values

## Prerequisites

### Required
- **Mochie Screen FX** shader package installed
  - Free version: [https://github.com/MochiesCode/Mochies-Unity-Shaders](https://github.com/MochiesCode/Mochies-Unity-Shaders)
  - Patreon SFX X version: [https://www.patreon.com/c/mochieshaders/posts](https://www.patreon.com/c/mochieshaders/posts)
- **AudioLink** in scene (for AudioLink features)

## Configuration

### Basic Setup

[Setting up Screen Shaders](setting-up-screen-shaders.md)

TODO: more info to come soon. This folder type should be pretty stable.

## Mochie Folder vs. Shaders Folder

**Use Mochie Folder when**:
- Using Mochie Screen FX specifically
- Need advanced Mochie-specific controls
- Require +/- adjustment controls
- Don't want to deal with manually creating materials and conflicting shaders

**Use Shaders Folder when**:
- Using non-Mochie shaders
- Need simple on/off control
- Want generic shader launching
- Don't need Mochie-specific features

## Next Steps

- [June Folder](june-folder.md) - Alternative shader system control
- [Shaders Folder](shaders-folder.md) - Generic shader launching
- [Fader System](setting-up-fader-system.md) - Add real-time control
- [Presets Folder](presets-folder.md) - Save Mochie configurations
